  abstract = {In recent years, many Colleges and Universities in the USA have been facing a serious financial crisis since many state governments have reduced their support for higher education. There is no doubt that one of the solutions to this crisis depends on the successful implementation of University fund raising programs. Identifying the potential donors is an important part of this process. The objective of this research was to develop a cascade-correlation neural network to predict the types of people who would most likely be potential donors. A comparison of the classification accuracy between neural networks and multiple discriminant analyses (MDA) was also conducted. Our results indicated that neural networks could perform as well as MDA in overall accuracy. Furthermore, neural networks could predict with a lot more accuracy the actual donor (Type I hit) than MDA. Our study is the first published case study on the use of artificial neural networks for University fund raising.},

  abstract = {The expected high volume imagery data from Nasa Mission to the Planet Earth is one of the target application areas for automated cloud retrieval, and more generally for automated image classification. We used the backpropagation (BP), the cascade-correlation (CC) and Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) neural network architectures for cloud retrieval from satellite imagery. We have used a simple scene (a mixed scene containing only cloud and ocean). This simple scene allows us to evaluate the accuracy of the classification better than a complicated scene. Both BP and CC performed at the same accuracy level, while the SOM algorithm was slightly less accurate in performing unsupervised learning. This study shows that for simple scenes, which are abundant in global monitoring satellite imagery, a simple pixel-by-pixel or 3x3 window approaches provide high accuracy classification without using complicated contextual information.},

  title = {{{EEG}} Based Gesture Mimicking by an Artificial Limb Using Cascade-Correlation Learning Architecture},
  doi = {10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727814},
  abstract = {Patients with prosthesis defects find it is very difficult to perform day-to-day basic tasks which involve employment of their limbs. This motivates us to develop a system where an artificial limb is employed to mimic the arm gestures of the patients for assisting them. Towards developing this system, we have taken the help from the electroencephalography (EEG) signals acquired from the brain of the patients to build a bypass network (BPN) to direct the artificial limb. Since difficulties are already present in the arm movements of the patients (here subjects), thus only gestures of those subjects are not sufficient to build the proposed system. This research finds tremendous applications in rehabilitative aid for the disable persons. To concretize our goal we have developed an experimental setup, where the target subject (for training phase healthy subjects are taken into account) is asked to catch a ball while his/her brain (occipital, parietal and motor cortex) signals using EEG acquisition device and body gestures using Kinect sensor are simultaneously acquired. These data are mapped using four cascade-correlation learning architecture (CCLA) to train artificial limb (we have used Jaco robot arm) to move accordingly. Utilizing the mapping results obtained from these four CCLAs, a BPN is developed. When a rehabilitative patient is unable to catch the ball, then in that scenario, the artificial limb is helpful for assisting the patient to catch the ball with a high accuracy of 85.65\%. The proposed system can be implemented not only for ball catching experiment but also in several applications where an artificial limb needs to perform a locomotive task based on EEG and body gesture.},

While CNN has been widely studied and evaluated in computer vision, there are other forms of deep learning algorithms which may be promising.

  abstract = {Software cost estimation is a crucial element in project management. Failing to use a proper cost estimation method might lead to project failures. According to the Standish Chaos Report, 65\% of software projects are delivered over budget or after the delivery deadline. Conducting software cost estimation in the early stages of the software life cycle is important and this would be helpful to project managers to bid on projects. In this paper, we propose a novel model to predict software effort from use case diagrams using a cascade correlation neural network approach. The proposed model was evaluated based on the MMER and PRED criteria using 214 industrial and 26 educational projects against a multiple linear regression model and the Use Case Point model. The results show that the proposed cascade correlation neural network can be used with promising results as an alternative approach to predict software effort.},
